            <h2>Benefits of Running</h2>
            <div class="benefits-card">
                <p>Running is one of the most accessible and effective forms of exercise, offering a multitude of physical and mental health benefits. According to the American Heart Association, regular running can reduce the risk of heart disease by 45% and lower the risk of stroke. Additionally, a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that even just 50 minutes of running per week can significantly extend lifespan, highlighting its profound impact on longevity.</p>
                <p>Beyond cardiovascular health, running helps to strengthen muscles, improve joint stability, and enhance lung capacity. The activity also aids in weight management, with the Mayo Clinic estimating that a person weighing 155 pounds burns approximately 298 calories during a 30-minute run at a moderate pace. This makes running an efficient exercise for those looking to maintain or lose weight.</p>
                <p>Mentally, running serves as a powerful tool for reducing stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. The "runner's high," a euphoric feeling induced by the release of endorphins during prolonged exercise, is a well-documented phenomenon that contributes to overall well-being. According to a study in the Journal of Adolescent Health, physical activities like running are linked to improved mental health in adolescents and adults alike.</p>
                <p>Fun facts about running: The fastest marathon ever recorded was completed by Eliud Kipchoge in under two hours, a feat long considered nearly impossible. Moreover, the longest race in the world, the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race, takes place over 52 days and requires participants to run nearly 60 miles a day!</p>
                <p>Whether you're an elite athlete or a casual jogger, the benefits of running are clear and substantial. From enhancing physical health to boosting mental clarity and extending lifespan, running stands out as a simple yet profoundly effective way to improve overall quality of life. So, lace up your shoes and hit the pavement—your body and mind will thank you!</p>

                        <h3>Amon Roca</h3>
                        <p>Running has been an incredible journey for me over the past three years. During this time, I’ve embraced the challenge of completing a full marathon, three half marathons, and several shorter races, including distances of 12, 10, 8, and 5 kilometers. Each race has not only tested my endurance and determination but also fueled my passion for the sport.</p>
                        <p>What I love most about running is the opportunity it gives me to constantly push my limits and grow stronger, both physically and mentally. Sharing my experiences and the lessons I’ve learned along the way has become a meaningful part of my journey. I take great joy in offering support and guidance to beginners, helping them navigate the ups and downs of their own running paths. Whether it's through training tips, motivational stories, or simply being a source of encouragement, I’m dedicated to fostering a supportive community of runners.</p>
