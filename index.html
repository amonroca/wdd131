                        My name is Amon. I've been married for almost 15 years and am the father of 3 beautiful kids. I have worked with 
                        information technology for over 15 years, 8 of them as a solutions architect. I graduated in digital games development 
                        and post-graduated in software engineering with a major in service-oriented architecture. At BYU I'm pursuing a software 
                        development degree. In my free time, I like to play video games with my kids and run marathons. I'm also a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
